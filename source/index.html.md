# Introduction

Welcome to the FlowCommand API. You can use our API to access information on your FlowCommand flow sensors and pings (sensor readings) from those sensors.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: Token api-auth-token"
```

> Make sure to replace `api-auth-token` with your API key.

FlowCommand uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can request an API key from your FlowCommand representative.

FlowCommand expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Token api-auth-token`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>api-auth-token</code> with your personal API key.

# Flow Sensors

## Get All Flow Sensors

```shell
curl "https://app.flowcommand.com/api/v1/flow_sensors/"
  -H "Authorization: Token api-auth-token"
```


> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
	"count": 2,
	"next": null,
	"previous": null,
	"results": [{
		"id": 1,
		"name": "Sensor 1",
		"latitude": 29.760435,
		"longitude": -95.3698,
		"pipe_diameter": 14.64,
		"last_ping_flowrate": 5356.92,
		"last_ping_datetime": "2019-02-05T20:41:02+00:00"
	}, {
		"id": 2,
		"name": "Sensor 2",
		"latitude": 29.760435,
		"longitude": -95.3698,
		"pipe_diameter": 19.14,
		"last_ping_flowrate": 0,
		"last_ping_datetime": "2019-02-05T20:15:08+00:00"
	}]
}
```

This endpoint retrieves all flow sensors ordered by id.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://app.flowcommand.com/api/v1/flow_sensors/`

### Query Parameters

Parameter | Default | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
page | 1 | Page (each page contains 1000 items)

<aside class="success">
Remember — add Authorization header to every request!
</aside>

## Get Pings for a Specific Flow Sensor

```shell
curl "https://app.flowcommand.com/api/v1/flow_sensors/1/pings/"
  -H "Authorization: Token api-auth-token"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
	"count": 2,
	"next": null,
	"previous": null,
	"results": [{
		"id": 1,
		"sensor_id": 1,
		"sensor_name": "Sensor 1",
		"flowrate": 759.99,
		"datetime": "2019-02-05T20:15:08+00:00"
	}, {
		"id": 2,
		"sensor_id": 1,
		"sensor_name": "Sensor 1",
		"flowrate": 0.0,
		"datetime": "2019-02-05T19:44:09+00:00"
	}]
}
```

This endpoint retrieves pings for a given flow sensor, ordered by datetime of the sensor reading (newest to oldest).

### HTTP Request

`GET https://app.flowcommand.com/api/v1/flow_sensors/<FLOW_SENSOR_ID>/pings/`

### URL Parameters

Parameter | Default | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
page | 1 | Page (each page contains 1000 items)
